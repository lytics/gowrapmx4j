Go Wrap MX4J
------------


Golang wrapper package for accesssing MX4J HTTP data. JMX is useful but horrible, MX4J provides an HTTP endpoint to access JMX data but is shrouded in misleading documentation.

This package aims to provide a simple Go library to query configurable MX4J data to make interacting with Java systems less painful.

 ...More to come.
